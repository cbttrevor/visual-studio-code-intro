## Learning Objectives

Visual Studio Code is powerful out of the box, however sometimes you'll need to tweak your settings.
There is a per-user configuration for Visual Studio Code, along with a per-workspace configuration file.
Workspace settings will override any settings in the user settings file.

You can configure VSCode using the GUI or by directly editing the JSON text.
I personally prefer editing the JSON text, as it gives me direct control over what's entered.
VSCode uses JSON schema to help auto-complete configuration settings and values.

There are literally hundreds of configuration options in VSCode.
Examples of customizations you can apply include:

* Indent with tabs or spaces
* 

### Settings Sync

Settings Sync is a preview feature in VSCode that allows you to synchronize your VSCode settings, extensions, user snippets, key bindings, and UI state.
This feature is useful if you frequently are switching between more than one development workstation.
You can sign into Settings Sync using Microsoft or GitHub authentication.

Other applications, such as Google Chrome, offer similar settings synchronization functionality.
When you sign into the application, you automatically get your browser favorites and extensions synchronized.
