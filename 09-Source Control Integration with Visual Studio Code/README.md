## Learning Objectives

One of the great integrations in Visual Studio Code is the source control integration.
Git integration out of the box gives you the ability to create new code repositories, commit changes to your code, and synchronize changes with a git server.

Although git integration is native to VSCode, you can also use other source control tools.
For example, you can use Mercurial, a distributed version control system (VCS) with Visual Studio Code as well.

You can use the command palette to search for git commits, such as `commit`, `stash`, `push`, `branch`, and more.
The visual area of Source Control in VSCode allows you to multi-select files that you want to stage for committing.

There's also a drop-down menu in the Source Control activity that allows you to perform common git operations.
