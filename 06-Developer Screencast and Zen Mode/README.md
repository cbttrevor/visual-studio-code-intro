### Screencast Mode

If you're a developer who's planning to build training content, either internally or for public consumption, screencast mode can be incredibly helpful.
Screencast mode is built into VSCode and enables you to display keystrokes while you're typing.
As people are watching your video, it may not immediately be clear what keyboard shortcuts you're using.
Screencast mode helps to solve for that by showing the keys as they're typed.

### Zen Mode

Zen mode helps you focus on writing your code, avoiding distractions from the rest of the VSCode user interface.
This mode eliminates the activity bar, sidebar, title bar, and status bar, leaving you with the editor.
It's effectively the same as hiding each of those elements individually.
By default, Zen mode can be activated using the `CTRL + K, Z` keyboard sequence.

There are a bunch of settings that you can use to customize Zen mode.
If you don't want Zen mode to center your code, you can set `zenMode.centerLayout` to `false`.
